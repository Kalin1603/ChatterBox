## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get ChatterBox running locally:

**1. Prerequisites:**

* [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) or later
* [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (Express, Developer, or other editions) or another configured EF Core compatible database.

**2. Clone the Repository:**

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME/ChatterBox.git with your actual repository URL
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ChatterBox.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ChatterBox.git)
cd ChatterBox
3. Configure Application Secrets:

Database Connection: It's highly recommended to use User Secrets for sensitive data like connection strings.

Bash

dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=ChatterBoxDb_Dev;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
(Adjust the connection string for your specific SQL Server instance if needed)

Email Settings (Optional): If you plan to test email features (confirmation, password reset), configure your email provider settings via User Secrets:

Bash

dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:SmtpServer" "smtp.example.com"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:Port" "587"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:SenderName" "ChatterBox Notifications"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:SenderEmail" "noreply@example.com"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:Username" "your_smtp_username"
dotnet user-secrets set "EmailSettings:Password" "your_smtp_password"
(Alternatively, configure these in appsettings.Development.json for local development only, but avoid committing credentials).

4. Restore Dependencies:

Bash

dotnet restore
5. Apply Database Migrations:

This command creates the database (if it doesn't exist) and applies the schema based on the EF Core migrations.

Bash

dotnet ef database update
6. Run the Application:

Bash

dotnet run
The application will typically be available at https://localhost:xxxx and http://localhost:yyyy. Check the console output for the exact URLs.
